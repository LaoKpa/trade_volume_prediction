# Trade Volume Prediction

## Abstract
Purpose of this project is to develop model for prediction of the **S&amp;P 500 Volume**.

## Validation
Only historical data can be used for prediction of the volume: Volume(t)=f(Features(1,...,t-1))

Validation will be performed on the volume between 2017/1/1 - 2018/12/31.

## Data
Any data available can be used. Historical market data can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is in the Jupyter Notebook: [exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb](notebook/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)

## Traditional Machine Learning models
Baseline and few traditional Machine Learning model results are in the Jupyter Notebook: [machine_learning.ipynb](notebook/machine_learning.ipynb)

## Deep Learning models
Deep Learning models (actually only LSTM model at the present) is in the Jupyter Notebook: [deep_learning.ipynb](notebook/deep_learning.ipynb)
